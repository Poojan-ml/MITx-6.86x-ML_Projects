## This includes all of my Python solutions for projects of MITx 6.86x Machine Learning course(2020 Run) offered on edX.

[__Automatic Reveiw Analyzer__](https://github.com/Poojan-ml/MITx-6.86x-ML_Projects/tree/main/Automatic_Review_Analyzer/sentiment_analysis) is based on NLP where sentiment analysis is performed based on the linear models using 'bag of words' as a feature.

[__Digit Recognition__](https://github.com/Poojan-ml/MITx-6.86x-ML_Projects/tree/main/Digit_Recognition) are based on Computer Vision where digit recognition is performed on mnist dataset based on various linear models like SVM and various deep-learning based models like ANN and CNN.

[__Collaborative Filtering__](https://github.com/Poojan-ml/MITx-6.86x-ML_Projects/tree/main/Collaborative_Filtering/netflix-collaborative%20filtering) is based on Unsupervised learning where colobarative filtering is perfomred on the data matrix containing movie ratings made by Netflix users. The goal is to predict remaining entries of movie ratings matrix which could be used to recommend unseen movies to users.

[__Text-Based Game__](https://github.com/Poojan-ml/MITx-6.86x-ML_Projects/tree/main/Text_Based_Game/Reinforcement_learning) is based on Reinforcement Learning where various algorithms such as tabular Q-learning, Deep Q network are implemented to learn control based policies for a text based game. 

__Note__: _This repo also includes code written by the course staff._
